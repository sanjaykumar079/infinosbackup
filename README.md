Project Overview: INFINOS - IoT Device Management System
This is a full-stack IoT monitoring and control system for managing thermal regulation devices (heaters, coolers, and batteries). Here's the comprehensive breakdown:
🎯 What It Does
INFINOS is a web-based platform for remotely monitoring and controlling temperature-controlled storage devices (like medical/pharmaceutical transport bags). It provides:

Real-time device monitoring - Track temperature, humidity, and battery levels
Remote control - Adjust settings, toggle fans, switch between heating/cooling modes
Data visualization - View historical trends through charts
Multi-device management - Add and manage multiple devices from one dashboard
Data logging - Export device logs as PDFs for compliance/records

🏗️ Architecture
Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js (mobile-responsive UI)
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: MongoDB (cloud-hosted on MongoDB Atlas)
Communication: REST API with axios
Visualization: Chart.js for time-series graphs

🔧 How It Works
Backend Components (infinosbackend/)
1. Database Models (Mongoose schemas):

Device: Main container holding references to heaters/coolers/batteries, safety thresholds
Heater: Stores desired temp, observed temps over time, control modes (continuous/discrete), fan status
Cooler: Similar to heater but for cooling
Battery: Tracks charge levels, temperature, fan status

2. API Endpoints (routes/Device.js):
GET  /device/                    → List all devices
POST /device/add_device          → Create new device
POST /device/add_heater/cooler/battery → Add components
POST /device/ass_heater          → Associate heater with device
POST /device/update_heater_temp  → Log new temperature reading
GET  /device/get_heaters         → Fetch heater data
... (similar for coolers/batteries)
3. Server (server.js):

Runs on port 4000
Connects to MongoDB Atlas cluster
Enables CORS for frontend communication

Frontend Components (infinosfrontend/)
1. Home Page (Home.js):

Landing page with branding
Navigate to device list

2. Devices Page (Devices.js):

Lists all devices with status (connected/disconnected)
Toggle device on/off with custom switches
Add new devices dynamically
Download logs - Generates PDF reports with temperature/humidity/battery data history

3. Control Page (Control.js):

Control Tab:

Real-time display of sensor readings
Adjust desired temperatures
Switch between continuous/discrete heating modes
Toggle fans
Visual safety indicators (low/bag/high temperature zones)
Add heaters/coolers/batteries to active device


Analysis Tab:

Line charts showing last 8-10 readings
Separate graphs for each component's temperature/charge trends



4. Data Visualization (LineChart.js):

Wrapper for Chart.js line graphs
Displays time-series data with timestamps

🔑 Key Features

Real-time Updates: Frontend polls backend every second for fresh data
State Management: Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for UI state
Timestamps: All readings stored with IST timezone conversion
Safety Zones: Color-coded temperature thresholds (blue/gray/red)
Session Management: Uses localStorage to track active device
Responsive Design: Mobile-first CSS (max-width: 360px)
PDF Reports: Uses jsPDF + autoTable for log generation with last 1000 readings

🎨 UI Design

Custom gradient buttons (cyan-blue, gold, purple)
Material-UI components (Switches, TextFields, Buttons)
SVG logos
Chart visualizations
Mobile-optimized layout

🚀 Deployment Setup

Backend: Hosted on AWS EC2 (IP: 13.234.232.67)
Frontend: Proxies to localhost:4000 during development
Database: MongoDB Atlas cloud cluster

💡 Use Case Example
Imagine a pharmaceutical delivery van carrying temperature-sensitive vaccines:

Van has INFINOS device with heating/cooling/battery
Dispatcher monitors temperature remotely via web app
If temperature drifts, system automatically adjusts heater/cooler
If connection lost, device operates autonomously in "discrete" mode
At end of route, driver downloads PDF log for compliance records

This system ensures cold chain integrity for medical supplies, food transport, or any temperature-controlled logistics.
